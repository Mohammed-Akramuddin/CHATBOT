# CHATBOT
# Chatbot using LangChain, OllamaLLM3, Flask

This project is a chatbot built using LangChain and OllamaLLM3 for natural language processing, Flask for backend API management, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The chatbot is designed to answer user queries interactively with a seamless interface.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Powered by LangChain and OllamaLLM3, enabling intelligent responses based on user input.
- **Real-time Communication**: The chatbot supports real-time interaction using Flask for API endpoints.
- **User Interface**: A simple and intuitive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enable seamless conversation with the bot.
- **Microphone Input**: Users can use the microphone to input queries using the SpeechRecognition API (JavaScript).

## Tech Stack

- **LangChain**: For chaining LLMs and managing NLP tasks.
- **OllamaLLM3**: A powerful language model used for generating chatbot responses.
- **Flask**: Web framework for the backend API, serving as the chatbot's brain.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend for rendering the chatbot interface and handling user input.
- **SpeechRecognition API**: For enabling voice input through the browser.

## Setup

To run this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

``bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-project.git
cd chatbot-project
..
2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt file includes necessary dependencies like flask, langchain, openai, etc.
3. Setup Flask Backend
Ensure you have a .env file or environment variables set for any sensitive data (e.g., API keys for OllamaLLM3).

bash
Copy code
FLASK_APP=app.py
FLASK_ENV=development
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
flask run
By default, the backend will be accessible at http://localhost:5000.

4. Frontend Setup
The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses AJAX to send user inputs to the Flask API and receive chatbot responses.

5. Voice Input Feature
To enable the voice input feature, ensure your browser has microphone permissions enabled. The app uses the SpeechRecognition API, which is supported in most modern browsers (Chrome, Edge).

6. Access the Chatbot
Once the Flask app is running, navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your browser. You can interact with the chatbot via the text input or use the microphone button to input voice commands.
